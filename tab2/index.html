                    According to a 2016 study published in the journal Science Advances,
                    83 percent of the world’s population lives under
                    <span>light-polluted</span> skies, with one-third of humans unable to
                    see the Milky Way at all. Later findings, in the same journal, noted
                    that the amount of <span>light</span>-touched land increases by roughly
                    two percent every year.

                “<span>Light pollution</span> is absolutely growing,” Ashley Wilson,
                director of conservation for the International Dark-Sky Association
                (IDA), an organization working to combat <span>light pollution</span>,
                told me. “Not even just our use of <span>light</span>, but the excessive
                use of it. There was a report published earlier this year by the
                Department of Energy which stated that 99 percent of the
                <span>light</span> that we emit has no clear purpose. It boggles my
                mind.

                    My analogy is with water. You would never want to leave your
                    sprinklers on all night in the hope it is going to water a specific
                    plant in a pot. Why are we doing the same with our <span>light</span>?”

                according to IDA. It’s “a sensory pollutant, much like noise,” said
                Andrea Bonisoli Alquati, Ph.D., an assistant professor of biological
                sciences at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. “We’re
                not talking about chemicals that are spread in the environment as is
                usual for <span>pollution</span>. Instead, we’re talking about the physical
                quality of the environment through the senses.”

                The most known form of <span>light pollution</span> is the big-city stuff: the
                brightly-lit buildings, the invasive LED glow of billboards and
                airports and parking lots. Those obnoxiously orange street<span>light</span>s.
                This is called skyglow.

                <p>
                    As Tyler Nordgren, Ph.D., an astronomer who previously worked for the National Park Service, explained it:
                    Skyglow happens when <span>light</span> beams travel up into the air and
                    encounter vapors, dust particles and pollutants, which then causes
                    the <span>light</span> to scatter. And so, instead of shooting off into space,
                    it’s sent back to Earth, meaning that all you see is a dome of
