                    <p>In Ulster County, where my home is, there are dark-sky compliant lighting standards in the majority of the town’s zoning statutes, but most of its municipal codes for residential areas don’t include light pollution as a form of nuisance, according to Dennis Doyle, director of the county’s planning department. And even those that do, enforcement is sporadic, if it happens at all. Cross a county line and the rules may be entirely different.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="two">
                    <p>The unchanging fact is that there are no official dark-sky areas in the Catskills, according to IDA. From one of my favorite lookout points, I can gaze out over the valleys in between the peaks and see unwieldy patches of light, a melancholy blue glow where darkness used to be. It’s not the city-sized incandescence I’m used to, but as I know all too well, just a few bad lights can change everything.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="three">
                    <p>Others know it, too. Earlier this year, New York State Senator Brad Hoylman, a Manhattan Democrat, introduced legislation called the “Dark Skies Act” in hopes of creating a uniform set of rules for outdoor artificial lighting to preserve the night sky. It has yet to pass the Environmental Conservation Committee for a vote.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="four">
                    <p>Now feels like the time to clarify: I am not anti-light. When I say I love the dark, what I mean is: watching the trees move in the candlelight beams of the moon, seeing the clouds shape-shift around the stars, catching a vignette of lightning bugs sparking in the folds of summer’s dusk. To appreciate the dark is to love light in its most wild and unfiltered form. It’s an opportunity to see things, just in a different way.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="five">
                    <p>I also recognize that what I see as an irritant, others see as a form of safety. (Although it’s worth noting that various studies fail to show a correlation between lower crime and more lights, and in fact, many experts I spoke with said that over-lighting gives criminals dark spaces to operate in. An always-on light is less of an alert than, say, a motion light that signals the arrival of a new presence.) I recognize that what makes me moony about not having outdoor lighting, others see as a hazard. Including my own mom. Once, when visiting me, she tripped as she went out to get something out of her car. I have heard about how I need to install outdoor lighting ever since. It’s really about being “dark-sky friendly, which doesn’t mean dark ground,” Ms. Foott rightly pointed out to me.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="six">
                    <p>It is with this in mind that I finally built up the courage to talk to one of my closest neighbors. I knocked, they didn’t answer, and to be honest, I have yet to knock again. My fellow dark-sky acolytes at IDA suggested writing a letter, making sure I’m clear in that I’m not asking my neighbor to take down their light, but simply redirect it to the ground. Most of the time, every single expert I spoke to reminded me, a neighbor isn’t even aware that there’s an issue.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="seven">
                    <p>There is a reason that conversations like this feel hard: It can seem nit-picky, tricky to reach a consensus on how much light is too much. (In reality, it is not. Dark-sky friendly lighting should be pointed downward, shielded, warm in color, the lowest light level possible, and serve a clear purpose.)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="eight">
                    <p>But while noise, messy yards, and other ilk that rile up homeowner’s associations, are recognized as problems, we don’t see light in the same way. An example: If a neighbor had an incessantly barking dog or was throwing nightly ragers, we would never tell the person on the receiving end of all those decibels to install better insulation. But the onus to solve the problem of light pollution is often placed on the aggrieved party to install blackout curtains, draw the shades, calm down.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="nine">
                    <p>“You can install blackout curtains, but birds can’t, insects can’t, people facing homelessness can’t,” Ms. Foott said, adding later, “You have a right for your property to be lit in the way you want it to. Access to the night sky should be a human right.”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="ten">
                    <p>Except that light has been billed to us as inherently good. It’s seen as soft and harmless. Leaving a light on for someone, a harbinger of a safe port. You are welcome here. The dark is for bad guys and boogeymen.</p>
