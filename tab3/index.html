            <p>But you don’t need New York City-level wattage to experience light pollution. In addition to light trespass, another type of light pollution is glare: when a bright object shines into <span>our eyes</span>, causing our night vision to become so overwhelmed we <span>can no longer see</span> faint objects. Faraway stars, distant <span>things</span> in the sky, meteor showers — <span>they all disappear</span>, Mr. Nordgren said.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
            <p>Think about the poetry, the discoveries, the stories — Vincent van Gogh’s “The Starry Night” — all made possible by looking up. “I don’t think people realize what <span>we're</span> in the process of <span>losing</span>,” Mr. Nordgren wistfully told me.</p>
            </div>
        <div class="three">
            <p>To put it another way: The collective want to illuminate a shed at all hours comes at a great cost. “To feel awe at the night sky means you have felt this smallness or this grandness or this interconnectedness to the world around you,” Mr. Nordgren said, adding later, “If you never look up because there’s nothing there to see, suddenly you’ve shrunk the universe — this thing that is millions of light years across — down to just you, your neighborhood, and your own problems. It shrinks us and it shrinks us in a depressing way.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="four">
            <p>Then there’s the harm to <span>humans</span> from the over-lighting of our lives. “Up to one in five genes became activated with a daily or circadian rhythm, with hundreds directly involved in its control,” Mr. Bonisoli Alquati said. “If the signals — natural light and darkness — that tie those rhythms together is deregulated, it is potentially affecting many other functions in our bodies.” Several studies have even shown an increased risk of cancer for those exposed to artificial light.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="five">
            <p>Entire ecosystems <span>suffer</span>, too, including bird migration patterns, turtle nesting, even the rest cycle of trees. “There has not been one species that has been studied that has not been affected by light pollution,” said Bettymaya Foott, director of engagement at IDA. “More than half of species are nocturnal.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="six">
            <p>Which is why rural communities in particular, like those in the Catskills, stand to lose so much. They are ecologically-rich areas, while serving as some of the last portals into our night skies. But like everything, the pandemic changed things in many mountain towns, as an influx of people gravitated toward the area. This means more homes and more development and more traffic. All things that bring the accouterment of light.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="seven">
            <p>“<span>Dark skies are</span> disappearing everywhere; this is not just a problem in the urban environment,” Mr. Bonisoli Alquati said. “It doesn’t take the extent of light that is present in cities to have effects on organisms and people.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="eight">
            <p>And yet, light pollution ordinances don’t always exist. This isn’t a function of small towns, but most places. The focus on conservation is often centered much more on land and water. Space, and by function, the sky, has always been out there, something</p>
