        <div class="container">
            <div class="one">
                <p>After over a decade of living in the city, I chose the plot of land, a flat patchwork of pine and oak at the base of the Catskill Mountains, for its terrible lighting.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="two">
                <p>The area so dark, I could watch the champagne fizz of shooting stars from my bedroom window; catch a glimpse of the harvest moon while brushing my teeth. Every evening, the night pressed in against my windows in a way that felt visceral, like a velvet blanket tucking me in.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="three">
                <p>This was by design.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="four">
                <p>When I had my 1,900-square-foot home built — pocketed away from the road, with trees and mountain brush mostly hiding signs of any nearby houses — I chose floor-to-ceiling glass in place of opaque walls. So deep was my desire to connect to the outside, to the night skies, that when the cost of construction threatened to go over my budget, I cut out air conditioning instead of a chance at a view. Since then, I’ve never even thought about curtains.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="five">
                <p>Why would I? The dark skies were a salve.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="six">
                <p>But not anymore. Or, at least, not in the same way.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="seven">
                <p>There has been an uptick in nearby lights from neighbors, which means an artificial fluorescence now blots out the sky at times, while leaking an ambient glow into my yard, my bedroom, everywhere.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="eight">
                <p>One particular floodlight ripples out a harsh, chlorine-white light from dusk to dawn. The omnipresent light giving the sense that someone is always there. If I sit on one edge of my couch, the bulb shines in my face like a spotlight.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="nine">
                <p>More than being a thorn, there is a name for this: light trespass. It is a term to describe a form of light pollution where illumination — from a neighbor or a business or street lighting — spills onto one’s property in a way that creates a disturbance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ten">
                <p>While not a commonly-known phrase, it is a common problem. In the course of reporting this story, I heard from upstate friends dealing with similar circumstances: a streetlamp erected on an otherwise pitch-black country road, a security light shining through the woods like an alien tractor beam into the person’s windows. Light-polluting neighbors whose trees shine “as bright as Broadway.” As one woman from a nearby upstate town posed to me:</p>
