        <p>It’s not just my dark sky disappearing, but everyone’s. According to a 2016 study published in the journal Science Advances, 83 percent of the world’s population lives under light-polluted skies, with one-third of humans unable to see the Milky Way at all. Later findings, in the same journal, noted that the amount of light-touched land increases by roughly two percent every year.</p>
        <p>“Light pollution is absolutely growing,” Ashley Wilson, director of conservation for the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA), an organization working to combat light pollution, told me. “Not even just our use of light, but the excessive use of it. There was a report published earlier this year by the Department of Energy which stated that 99 percent of the light that we emit has no clear purpose. It boggles my mind. My analogy is with water. You would never want to leave your sprinklers on all night in the hope it is going to water a specific plant in a pot. Why are we doing the same with our light?”</p>
        <p>As explanations go, light pollution is considered “the inappropriate or excessive use of artificial light,” according to IDA. It’s “a sensory pollutant, much like noise,” said Andrea Bonisoli Alquati, Ph.D., an assistant professor of biological sciences at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. “We’re not talking about chemicals that are spread in the environment as is usual for pollution. Instead, we’re talking about the physical quality of the environment through the senses.”</p>
        <p>The most known form of light pollution is the big-city stuff: the brightly-lit buildings, the invasive LED glow of billboards and airports and parking lots. Those obnoxiously orange streetlights. This is called skyglow. As Tyler Nordgren, Ph.D., an astronomer who previously worked for the National Park Service, explained it: Skyglow happens when light beams travel up into the air and encounter vapors, dust particles and pollutants, which then causes the light to scatter. And so, instead of shooting off into space, it’s sent back to Earth, meaning that all you see is a dome of</p>
