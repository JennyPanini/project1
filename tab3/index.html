        <p>In addition to light trespass, another type of light pollution is glare: when a bright object shines into our eyes, causing our night vision to become so overwhelmed we can no longer see faint objects. Faraway stars, distant things in the sky, meteor showers — they all disappear, Mr. Nordgren said.</p>
        <p>Think about the poetry, the discoveries, the stories — Vincent van Gogh’s “The Starry Night” — all made possible by looking up. “I don’t think people realize what we’re in the process of losing,” Mr. Nordgren wistfully told me.</p>
        <p>To put it another way: The collective want to illuminate a shed at all hours comes at a great cost. “To feel awe at the night sky means you have felt this smallness or this grandness or this interconnectedness to the world around you,” Mr. Nordgren said, adding later, “If you never look up because there’s nothing there to see, suddenly you’ve shrunk the universe — this thing that is millions of light years across — down to just you, your neighborhood, and your own problems. It shrinks us and it shrinks us in a depressing way.”</p>
        <p>Then there’s the harm to humans from the over-lighting of our lives. “Up to one in five genes became activated with a daily or circadian rhythm, with hundreds directly involved in its control,” Mr. Bonisoli Alquati said. “If the signals — natural light and darkness — that tie those rhythms together is deregulated, it is potentially affecting many other functions in our bodies.” Several studies have even shown an increased risk of cancer for those exposed to artificial light.</p>
        <p>Entire ecosystems suffer, too, including bird migration patterns, turtle nesting, even the rest cycle of trees. “There has not been one species that has been studied that has not been affected by light pollution,” said Bettymaya Foott, director of engagement at IDA.</p>
